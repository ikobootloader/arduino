# EEPROM TOOLS

Hi there!

i wrote this librairy of tools because my experiments became often bigger than i thunk at the beginning..

so, i mean it's better to have a librairy to minimize my sketch and use more simply the eeprom 24LC256. 

i think other librairies purpose this kind of stuff but i want to improve my skills in c/c++ and it's a good challenge for me !

most of functions need an address to start and an address to end. address to start is always littlest than the address to end.
