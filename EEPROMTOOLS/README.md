# EEPROM TOOLS

Hi there!

i wrote this librairy of tools because my experiments became often bigger than i thunk at the beginning..

so, i mean it's better to have a librairy to minimize my sketch and use more simply the eeprom. 

most of functions need an address to start and an address to end. address to start is always littlest than the address to end.
